# Demo for Integrating Authing in AWS China Region

This is a simple demo for integrating Authing in AWS China region to protect API Gateway REST API and other AWS resources, such as IoT, Polly and etc

Amazon Cognito User Pools provide a secure user directory that scales to hundreds of millions of users. As a fully managed service, User Pools are easy to set up without any worries about standing up server infrastructure. User Pools are widely used by lots of [AWS Solutions](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/) and applications developed by customers

Unfortunately Cognito User Pool is still not available in AWS China region and it becomes an obstacle when migrating AWS solutions and applications depending on Cognito User Pool. This project is to demostrate how to integrate Authing in AWS China region as a replacement for Cognito User Pool.
